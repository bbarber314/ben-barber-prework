                <p>What to say about Ben? Ben is a physicist by training, holding a Master's in Science in Physics from <a href="https://www.uchicago.edu/">the University of Chicago</a> and a Bachelor's in Science in Physics and Mathematics from <a href="https://www.valpo.edu/">Valparaiso University</a>. His graduate work focused on accelerator physics, the physics that goes into designing and building particle accelerators like the Large Hadron Collider. His projects ranged from analytic derivations of the wakefield following a particle bunch to surface studies of the effects of plasma cleaning on niobium (for use on superconducting accelerating cavities). As an undergrad, his work was focused on event analysis for particle collider experiments (using the ROOT library in C++) and on a variety of preparatory measurments for neutron electric dipole moment searches.</p>
                <p>Prior to this prework experience, Ben has previously worked in HTML, SQL, PHP, CSS, and C++, in addition to a number of techinal coding languages (including MatLab, Wolfram's Mathematica, and General Particle Tracer). His work previously largely focused on particle physics analysis on large data sets for experiments like the <a href="https://www.star.bnl.gov/">STAR collaboration at RHIC</a> and the <a href="https://home.cern/science/experiments/atlas">ATLAS collaboration at the LHC</a>.</p>
                <p>On a more fun note, Ben is a confirmed Pokémaniac, having completed the national Pokédex for Kalos and Alola (he's still working on Galar). He also founded and ran the Valparaiso University Human Protection Society for 3 years, an organization responsible for running campus-wide games of <a href="https://humansvszombies.org/">Humans Vs Zombies</a>. He has also served as a dungeon/game master for the roleplaying games Dungeons and Dragons (3.5 edition), Pathfinder, the World of Darkness, and Eclipse Phase.</p>
